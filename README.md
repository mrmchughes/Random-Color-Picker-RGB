# Random-Color-Picker-RGB
A simple randomized RGB color picker project from Colt Steele's Web Dev course. I put my own spin on it with the <p> element being where the generated color was displayed,
this left me room to have a short explanation on the page of what it did and how it worked with my <h1> and <h2> elements.
